# weather-app
A weather bar that can be inserted into any website that tells the current location, temperature and condition as well as a 3-day forecast. 

Note: This application does not update. I thought about having it update every hour, but i don't think it is necessary in the context of users going onto a website and checking the weather. It will update every time a user visits the app already.
