# weather-app
A weather bar that can be inserted into any website that tells the current location, temperature and condition as well as a 3-day forecast. 

Note: This application does not update. I thought about having it update every hour, but i don't think it is necessary in the context of users going onto a website and checking the weather. It will update every time a user visits the app already. 

This was built using a weather API found here: https://www.weatherapi.com/. You will need to create an account and insert your own API key. The icons can be downloaded and are found on the same site.
